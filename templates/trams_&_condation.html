				<h1>WePay Terms of Service - United States</h1>
				<span>dated: April 1, 2022</span>
				<p>
					These Terms of Service are a legal agreement (this "Agreement") between you ("user," "you" or "your") and WePay, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("WePay," "we," "our" or "us"). WePay is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”). As used in this Agreement, the "Service" refers to WePay's payment processing services, as well as our website, any software, programs, documentation, tools, hardware, internet-based services, components, and any updates (including software maintenance, service information, help content, bug fixes or maintenance releases) thereto provided to you by WePay, directly or indirectly. Your use of the Service constitutes confirmation of your acceptance and agreement to the terms of this Agreement.
				</p>
				<p>
					WePay offers the Service through integrations with third-party or Chase websites ("Platforms"). The Platform through which you access the Service might have its own terms of service and privacy policy that apply to you. This Agreement incorporates by reference all policies, notices, and other content that appear on our website at www.wepay.com as well as policies, notices, and other content concerning the Service that appear on the Platform's website (collectively, the "Website").
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>1. Merchant Relationship with WePay</h1>
				<p>
					WePay provides the Service to users ("Merchants") to facilitate receipt by Merchants of payments for goods or services or donations by card and bank transfer. These transactions are between Merchants and persons who pay them ("Purchasers"). Neither WePay, nor any Chase subsidiary or affiliate, is a party to these transactions.
				</p>
				<p>
					For payments by card, WePay initiates the payment process by providing information to Paymentech, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Paymentech"). Paymentech is a subsidiary of Chase which is a member of Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International ("Visa"), Mastercard International Incorporated ("MasterCard"), American Express Travel Related Services Company Inc. ("American Express"), or other payment card networks, associations, or companies (collectively, the "Card Networks"). Paymentech in its capacity as an authorized processor of transactions and Chase in its capacity as a member of several Card Networks are referred to collectively as the "Bank". WePay shall pay, or cause the Bank to pay, Merchants under both (a) the provisions of its agreement with WePay, and (b) the by-laws, operating regulations and all other rules, policies and procedures of the Card Networks as in effect from time to time (the "Card Network Rules"), that make WePay responsible for instructing settlement with you as a Merchant. For payments by bank transfer, WePay initiates the payment process by providing information to Chase through the National Automated Clearing House ("ACH") in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and The Electronic Payments Association Operating Rules and Guidelines ("ACH Rules"), each as in effect from time to time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Merchants must register for WePay directly or through the Platform. To register, a Merchant provides information, including email address and a self-selected password, in order to create an account ("Account"). You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your Account access credentials and for any use of or action taken under them.
				</p>
				<p>
					WePay or the Platform asks Merchants for additional information to identify each person that opens an Account, such as street address, telephone number, tax identification number (such as Social Security Number), date of birth and beneficial ownership information (where applicable). You agree to provide supplemental documentation upon request (including but not limited to: articles of incorporation, passports, driver's license or a business license and financial statements). You agree that the information provided is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge and authorize the Platform and WePay, directly or through third parties, to make inquiries or verify that this information is accurate (for example, through social media or third party databases). You specifically authorize WePay and the Platform to obtain your business credit reports from time to time and use them in connection with establishing and maintaining your Account. You agree to promptly notify WePay or the Platform, as applicable, if there are any significant changes to the nature of your business (including changes to any trade name(s)), product lines or services or in the event any person or entity acquires any beneficial ownership interest in you which is twenty-five percent (25%) or more.
				</p>
				<p>
					You must provide accurate and complete information to WePay and the Platform. Specifically, when you register, you must demonstrate that you can receive email at the email address you provide. If you do not confirm your email address, then (a) fourteen (14) days after you accept your first payment, you will not be able to accept additional payments, and (b) thirty (30) days after you accept your first payment, the Bank will refund to your Purchasers all of the payments you have accepted. In addition, in order to settle the payments you have accepted to your bank account or other payment instrument, you must provide to WePay or the Platform identity and settlement information (such as your bank account details). If you do not provide identity and settlement information, then (a) thirty (30) days after you accept your first payment, you will not be able to accept additional payments, and (b) unless you provide identity and settlement information promptly, the Bank will refund to your Purchasers all of the payments you have accepted. Finally, if at any time WePay or the Platform is unable to verify that the identity information you provided is correct and up-to-date, then, unless you provide verifiable information promptly, (a) WePay will disable your Account so that you cannot accept additional payments, and (b) the Bank will refund to your Purchasers all of the payments that you have accepted but not settled. Neither the Bank, WePay nor the Platform will have any liability to you for your inability to accept payments or for refunds pursuant to this paragraph.
				</p>
				<p>
					WePay allows businesses (including sole proprietorships), non-profit organizations and other entities to register for WePay if they are located in one of the 50 United States or the District of Columbia. Residents of Puerto Rico, U.S. territories (such as Guam), and U.S. military bases are not supported. A Merchant must be either a United States citizen, a legal permanent resident of the United States, a United States federal, state or local government agency or a United States business or nonprofit organization having a physical presence in the United States and authorized to conduct business by the state in which it operates. A user who opens an Account must be eighteen (18) years of age or older. You may open an Account for an entity only if it is legitimate and you have the authority to enter into this Agreement on its behalf. Your acceptance of this Agreement constitutes acceptance by the entity.
				</p>
				<p>
					USA PATRIOT ACT: To help prevent the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law and internal policies require us to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. In order to comply with these requirements, we will ask for your business name, physical address, and government identification number in order to verify your identity.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>2. Purchaser Relationship with WePay</h1>
				<p>
					This Agreement also applies to Purchasers. In particular, Section 9 of this Agreement applies to Purchasers paying by bank transfer and to payment card information updates.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>3. Platform Relationship with WePay</h1>
				<p>
					Platforms enter into <a href="#">Platform Terms of Service</a> with WePay.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>4. Limitations on WePay's and Others' Responsibility</h1>
				<p>
					Neither WePay, the Bank, nor any other third party makes any representations or guarantees regarding Merchants or Purchasers utilizing the Service. Use of our Service in no way represents any endorsement by WePay or any Card Network, of a user's existence, legitimacy, ability, policies, practices, or beliefs. WePay does not have control of, or liability for, goods or services that are paid for with the Service. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that receipt of Purchaser information via the Service does not indicate that the Purchaser’s payment instrument has sufficient available funds, that a transaction will be authorized or processed, or that the transaction will not later result in a chargeback or reversal.
				</p>
				<p>
					A nonprofit organization may use WePay to accept payments as a Merchant. Not all nonprofit organizations are tax-exempt, and not all contributions to nonprofit organizations are tax-deductible. Nonprofit organizations are responsible for correctly classifying themselves and their transactions, issuing any required reports and receipts, and making any required tax or other filings. Contributors are responsible for verifying the status of organizations to which they donate and reporting their donations correctly for tax and other purposes. WePay specifically disclaims any liability in this regard.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we (or the Platform) sell or otherwise provide you with terminals or other equipment, (1) we (or the Platform) are the equipment reseller, not the manufacturer, (2) we (or the Platform) will give you pricing and any additional terms (including any manufacturer’s warranty) before purchase, and (3) by accepting the equipment, you agree to any related additional terms.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>5. Merchant Fees</h1>
				<p>
					Platforms are responsible for setting fees for transaction processing and exceptions processing and disclosing them to their Merchants. Platforms may charge an additional fee for the value-added services they provide. If the Platform does not set transaction processing fees otherwise, then WePay charges the Platform’s Merchants 2.9% + $0.30 for transaction processing; $15.00 per chargeback (in addition to the amount of the chargeback); $15.00 per ACH return (in addition to the amount of the return); and a $25.00 research fee (if an Account is deemed abandoned under Section 22 below). If the Platform does not set refund fees otherwise, then the following refund policies apply. For Merchants with blended rate pricing, if the Merchant refunds a payment in full, WePay and Platform will return their transaction processing fees.  If Merchant refunds a payment in part, WePay will not return its transaction processing fees, and the Platform may choose whether to return its fees. For Merchants with Interchange+ pricing, the refund policy is as specified in the applicable pricing disclosure. Merchants must also reimburse WePay for “Payment Network Liabilities” as defined below in Section 8, Our Role and Your Responsibilities. Typically, fees are netted against other funds due to Merchant or debited from the Merchant’s bank account or other payment instrument associated with the Merchant’s Account. Merchant agrees to pay the fees for the Service that are posted from time to time by WePay or by the Platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					A Platform may enable a Merchant to increase the amount it collects from Purchasers by these fees or by other amounts. Certain Card Network Rules or state laws may prohibit or impose restrictions on the assessment of surcharges or similar fees added to credit card transactions. It is Merchant’s responsibility to comply with all such applicable Card Network Rules and state laws in connection with its decision to increase the total amount Merchant collects from Purchasers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Subject to the terms of this Agreement, WePay and the Platform reserve the right to change our fees. WePay or the Platform will try, but are not required, to give you 30 days’ notice before the effective date of any change in a fee. By continuing to use the Service, you consent to the change in fees. To withdraw your consent, you must close your Account.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>6. E-Sign Disclosure and Consent</h1>
				<span>Electronic Delivery</span>
				<p>
					By accepting this Agreement, you agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, notices and disclosures (collectively, "Communications") that we or the Platform provide in connection with your Account and your use of the Service. Communications include but are not limited to:
					1.  agreements and policies, such as this Agreement and our Privacy Policy, including updates thereto;
					2. annual disclosures;
					3.  transaction receipts or confirmations;
					4. communication in relation to delinquent accounts (which may also be by phone, and may be made by WePay or by anyone on its behalf, including a third party collection agent);
					5. Account statements and history; and
					6. federal and state tax statements (we may, but are not obligated to, send tax-related information electronically).
				</p>
				<p>
					We or the Platform will provide these Communications to you by emailing them to you at the primary email address listed in your Account registration, by texting them to you at the primary telephone number listed in your Account registration, by emailing or texting you a link or instructions how to access them on a website, or (if permitted by law) by posting them on the Website. We or the Platform may also provide certain Communications (such as federal and state tax statements) by U.S. mail to the street address listed in your Account registration. Communications are considered received by you within 24 hours of the time they are emailed to you, posted to the Website, or mailed to you. You further agree that your electronic signature has the same effect as your manual, physical signature.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>Hardware and Software Requirements</h1>
				<p>
					In order to access and retain electronic Communications, you will need the following computer hardware and software:
					1. a computer or mobile device with an Internet or mobile connection;
					2.  for desktop website-based Communications, a modern web browser that includes 256-bit encryption, such as the current version of Chrome (www.google.com/chrome), Internet Explorer (www.microsoft.com/edge), Mozilla Firefox (www.mozilla.com), or Apple Safari (www.apple.com/safari);
					3. for application-based Communications, a recent device operating system that supports text messaging, downloading, and applications from the Apple App Store or Google Play store, and the most recent versions of Apple Safari or Google Chrome on iOS or Google Chrome for Android OS;
					4. access to your primary email address registered with WePay or the Platform; and
					5. sufficient storage space to save past Communications or an installed printer to print them.
				</p>
				<p>
					By giving your consent, you are confirming that you have access to the necessary equipment and are able to receive, open, and print or download a copy of any Communications for your records. It is important for you to retain copies of Communications because they may not be accessible in your Account at a later date.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>How to Withdraw Your Consent</h1>
				<p>
					You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting Customer Support, including by writing to "WePay, Inc., 3223 Hanover St., Palo Alto, CA 94304." If you withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically, WePay or the Platform may deny your registration for an Account, restrict or close your Account, or charge you additional fees for paper copies.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>Requesting Paper Copies of Electronic Communications</h1>
				<p>
					If, after you consent to receive Communications electronically, you would like a paper copy of a Communication previously sent to you, you may request a copy within 180 days of the date the Communication was provided to you by contacting Customer Support as described above. We or the Platform will send a paper copy to you by U.S. mail to the street address on file in your Account. You understand and agree that WePay or the Platform may charge you an exceptions fee for each paper copy of a Communication.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>Updating Your Contact Information</h1>
				<p>
					It is your responsibility to keep your primary email and street address up to date. You understand and agree that if WePay or the Platform sends you a Communication but you do not receive it because your primary email or street address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, WePay or the Platform will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you. Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add WePay or the Platform to your email address book so that you will be able to receive the Communications we send to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					If your email address becomes invalid such that electronic Communications sent to you by WePay or the Platform are returned, then WePay or the Platform may close your Account, and you will not be able to transact any activity using your Account until we receive a valid, functioning primary email address from you.
